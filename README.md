- **Skills Gap Analysis**: Identify missing skills and qualifications needed for the role
- **Resume Enhancement**: Receive personalized recommendations to improve your application
- **Downloadable Reports**: Export analysis in Markdown or plain text formats
- **Session Caching**: Results are cached to provide consistent scores and reduce API calls

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit 1.32.0+
- PyPDF2 3.0.1+
- Requests 2.31.0+
- Asyncio 3.4.3+
- A Groq API key (register at [groq.com](https://groq.com))
